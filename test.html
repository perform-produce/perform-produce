            <p><span>Bridget Moser is a performance and video artist who combines strategies associated with prop
                comedy, experimental theatre, absurd literature, and intuitive dance in her work. She uses everyday
                objects that embody the aesthetics of mainstream consumer trends as her performance props, and often
                references popular cinema, advertising, home decor, and influencer culture in the design of her stage
                environments. Moser’s work uses humor and physical perfomance to explore themes of loneliness,
                absurdity, existential anxiety, and consumer culture, and often makes reference to art and design
                history in both her video pieces and live performances. She has presented work at the Art Gallery of
                Ontario, Remai Modern, le Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal, and the Vancouver Art Gallery among
                other venues.</span></p>

            <p><span>I first discovered you when I saw Every Room is a Waiting Room at the Art Museum at the University
                of Toronto back in 2017. As a designer, I was intrigued by how the work spoke in this hyper-commercial
                visual language that was both soft and familiar yet cold and alienating at the same time.</span></p>
            <p><span>So I wanted to begin this conversation by asking you about the design of your sets and the props
                you select for your performances. You often perform using mass-produced objects and within these visual
                worlds that are stylistically adjacent to mainstream fashion and beauty advertising.</span></p>
            <p><span>For example, your video, Every Room is a Waiting Room, was influenced by the 2016 Pantone® Color of
                the Year, and your more recent piece, My Crops are Dying but My Body Persists (2020), takes place across
                two sets that look like Instagram ads.</span></p>
            <p><span>Can you speak a little bit about the spaces you construct and the objects you perform with? Why
                metallic Crocs™, pink hair dryers, dusty rose velvet sofas?</span></p>

            <p><span>First, the idea for Every Room is a Waiting Room in particular goes quite a ways back. After I
                graduated from art school around 2009, I really didn’t know what the hell I was doing. I was living in
                Montreal and got an office job designing packaging for a wholesale cookware company, and I was
                surrounded by these stupid objects all the time that were just lying around in boxes everywhere. Looking
                back, I realize that a lot of my work comes from this experience and the absurdity I found in the
                inanimate things I was surrounded by and working with all the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>As part of that cookware job, I’d occasionally travel to these international houseware trade shows.
                They’re super weird and I love them because of that. I got to go to the biggest one which was in Chicago
                — Emeril was there, the Slap Chop™ guy was there — and it was amazing. The best part for me was this
                massive Pantone® booth at the center that predicted the upcoming color trends in houseware
                design.</span></p>
            <p><span>The whole setup went far beyond just advertising the Color of the Year. The booth showed at least
                ten different color stories with eight to ten chip palettes each. It had a whole narrative constructed
                around each one. I became obsessed with the whole thing because it was so absurd to me that this company
                had found a way to market and sell the idea of color. It was so preposterous, and I found it impossible
                not to see it as overdrive late capitalism.</span></p>
            <p><span>So I’d been thinking about this Pantone® booth for years. Then finally, in 2016, when the company
                announced the official color that year<sup>1</sup>, they announced it as two colors in a gradient. I
                thought this was just so ridiculous.</span></p>

            <p><span>Many of us at the moment were like, this is so stupid but also so amazing. The whole marketing
                around the colors was this narrative about how it was 2016 and this gradient was meant to represent
                peace and harmony. That’s what 2016 was going to be all about. They’d decided that gender was fluid
                (they solved this problem for us), and they were just like, “you’re welcome.” (laughs)</span></p>
            <p><span>But 2016 was the year Brexit happened. It was the year Trump got elected. I felt like it was the
                least harmonious year we’d had in a long time. And so it really felt like the moment to strike with this
                idea.</span></p>
            <p><span>At the time, I also really wanted to engage with the idea of consumption and production cycles;
                with objects that were just recently becoming irrelevant in terms of the trend cycle. I was interested
                in working with things that were being liquidated because the new Pantone® color was about to come out,
                and for practical reasons, that also meant it was affordable for me to buy all of these things to work
                with because everything was on sale.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p><span>I’m interested in this idea of things being right on the edge of a trend. I like that. I feel like
                these objects speak to these specific micro-moments in trends that reflect what we were all thinking
                about at a specific moment in time for no good reason. So this reaction to product lifecycles is one
                part of how that project started.</span></p>
            <p><span>Another thing that I think of as a throughline in my work is this feeling of loneliness or
                alienation. It’s always just me alone performing in my work which, in the begining, was mostly a
                practical decision. But now I think it just has a lot to do with what makes sense to me.</span></p>
            <p><span>I was thinking about these cinematic representations of the loneliest places in the universe, and
                I’ve never felt the same cold loneliness that I feel when l look at the room from the end of Stanley
                Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey<sup>2</sup>. When I made Every Room is a Waiting Room, I didn’t have a
                very big budget and I was trying to think of ways to evoke this lonely feeling. I’m not interested in
                digital effects like green screens, and because I use inanimate objects so much in my performances, I
                wanted the set to be made up of real, physical things. So the 2001 image on the seamless stands was the
                first instance of these types of photo backdrops making their way into my work.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>I used this image from 2001 which I combined with all of this imagery from the Color of the Year
                marketing campaign. And so I do think you’re pointing exactly to that tension between this cold
                loneliness and the Pantone® of it all. There’s a meaninglessness and pointlessness to this color
                marketing that I really wanted to work with.</span></p>

            <p><span>The worlds that you perform in are carefully designed, but you leave parts of your sets
                intentionally bare — they always reveal some aspect of their “stageness” somehow. Seamless structures
                are visible, you use gallery plinths instead of furniture to hold up objects, you stage things in front
                of flat backdrops with standard, unexpressive lighting. There’s something Brechtian<sup>3</sup> about
                this type of set design approach. Is this intentional? Do you want to remind the audience that they’re
                watching a performance?</span></p>

            <p><span>Yeah, I think so. One of the more recent works I did (which was part of a group exhibition) has a
                set that really reads like a theatre flat. I set up a small wall as a backdrop, but when the performance
                isn’t happening, the audience can walk across and around the set and see behind the “stage” which is
                basically just a plain wooden slat held with sandbags.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>I think of this as a very constructed kind of reality which makes sense to me because I’m often
                addressing these constructed senses of self and notions of self-identity.</span></p>

            <p><span>I find this technique particularly interesting because it provides a counter-balance to what
                marketing visuals are trying to do which is pull you into a world that you can imagine yourself
                inhabiting and living a particular lifestyle in. You’re taking these visual cues and this aesthetic
                language from beauty and lifestyle marketing, and flipping it in a way that alienates the viewer and
                sort of pushes them away. Your ability to create this distance, to reveal the artifice of it all, is
                very effective.</span></p>

            <p><span>I think about that piece as existing in two worlds. One is a sort of still-life setup at this
                table, and the other is this large and mostly empty white room.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>For the table-top setup, I think about it as a sort of macro world that echoes my body. I designed
                it to have all these pinks and beige-y tones that look like my own physical body—I tried to find objects
                and finishes that were as close as possible to my skin, my hair etc. I’m very pink and so is this world.
                (laughs)</span></p>
            <p><span>The second setup I used in the film, the larger white space, is a photo studio that’s mostly used
                by social media influencers. What was really compelling to me about this space was the fact that it’s
                this very pure, very white room with all of these decorative flourishes tacked on that are totally
                useless. It’s a room that doesn't do anything that any real room is supposed to do. There's a fake
                fireplace in it that’s not even pretending to be functional. It’s purely decorative. It’s just

                manipulative, dishonest side of design that I’ve directly participated in. When I say that, I mean the
                commercial realm of design that’s basically tasked with the fabrication of desire through the
                manipulation of surfaces. If you’re a graphic designer working for clients, it’s often your job to

            <p><span>Definitely. I feel like prop comedy wouldn’t exist at all without Marcel Duchamp. I also think
                there’s a very strong link between industrialization, modern art, and contemporary comedy, which is
                something David Robbins goes in-depth about in his book Concrete Comedy [06]. First, we needed
                mass-manufactured objects to get to readymades, and then we need readymades to get to prop comedy. So in
                some ways, using objects in this way is speaking to a history that is inclusive of both Duchamp and
                Carrot Top [07].</span><br><span>And I think they should be given equal weight or importance, though I

                your work. It seems like there are a ton of inside jokes happening about art and art history in your
                work. And maybe I’m just overly steeped in art academia right now, but I also see a lot of surrealist

            <p><span>Well, in the beginning, when I started making this kind of work, I didn’t consider my own presence
                particularly important. I had been making another type of work for a while, but it wasn’t very good. I
                think it's important for younger artists to know how much bad work you have to make in the beginning to
                understand what’s happening when the work starts getting better. So anyway, for me, the moment my work
                started getting better was when I started performing; when I started being the person to activate the
                things around me.</span></p>
            <p><span>Performance was this medium that allowed me to bring together all of the other things I was
                interested in but that I didn’t initially connect to my art practice. Writing is one example of
                something I always enjoyed but thought of as separate from visual art until I discovered that I could
                write things and then say them. I could dance and move which is also something I like to do. I’m
                interested in joke-making as well. And because I had worked with inanimate objects before, I realized
                that I could continue doing that in this new way using performance which also allowed me to express this
                interest in humor that I always had.</span></p>
            <p><span>Working with my own body started out of necessity because it was just me making work alone. But I
                recognized early on that performance actually works really well for me— it makes sense with the way my
                brain works more than anything else.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>This question of the feminist tradition of performance art has come up a few times recently. And
                it’s funny because there is a lot of talk about thwarting expectations of how women are expected to
                present in the world, even in the art context, but I don’t actually think about it that much. I’m often
                more focused on whichever bad ideas I have and how I can bring them to life in a way that’s interesting
                to me.</span></p>
            <p><span>I feel like my work is more personal and quite selfish in the sense that I’m often thinking about
                what pleases me. And maybe it just makes perfect sense that what pleases me is an inherently feminist
                action. Maybe it’s less of a conscious act and more about what is embedded in who I am as a person, if
                that makes any sense.&nbsp;</span></p>

                ways that sometimes verge on the grotesque (like when you wear those plastic prosthetic workout lips in
              </span><em><span>My Crops Are Dying</span></em><span>). It’s amazing because you always perform in a
                hyper-confident manner that subverts expectations about how women should present themselves in public or
                on-screen, female artists being no exception. As a spectator, I still read this as sort of a subversive
                act even if that’s not your main intention. &nbsp;</span></p>

            <p><span>Even when I’m performing some of these gestures that might read as less conceptually rigorous like
                putting a plunger on my stomach and then tapping something with it, that to me is partially about
                rejecting the expectation of what being a cis straight woman looks like. And especially what that looks
                like to me personally. I’m a blonde, blue-eyed white woman, but what I do doesn’t always fit into what
                that idea of femininity is and what it actually looks like. So I really like to do things that
                completely counteract those expectations and that reveal the falseness of those norms and the
                expectations associated with them. I love to be the opposite of that.</span></p>
            <p><span>There’s a great satisfaction for me in proposing an alternative to this idea of how I should act
                that is embarrassing but funny but discomforting all at the same time. That’s much more interesting and
                true to life for me than trying to meet these expectations that aren’t really grounded in anything I
                care about.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p><span>Well, sometimes I watch things back and think, “this video is not actually that funny.” (laughs)
                But there are different theories about what makes something funny. In fact, there are hundreds of years
                of thought and writing on what constitutes a joke. One of the prevailing theories I identify with most
                is the incongruity theory, which comes largely from Enlightenment thinking. Depending on whose writing
                you read, it essentially boils down to the perception of something incongruous causing us to laugh.
                Immanuel Kant described laughter as “an affection arising from the sudden transformation of a strained
                expectation into nothing.”<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>I’m very drawn to this definition as an artistic tool because it allows me to take these common
                ideas we have that seem to be inherently wrong or bad—ideas about women, ideas about race, ideas about
                consumption or capital—and sort of stretch them in an absurd way that reveals how empty and baseless
                they are. By stretching them in this absurd and hopefully humorous way, I can show how fallible and not
                worth holding onto they are. That works well as an artistic tool, and it’s also pleasurable. It feels
                good to laugh, and I think that's also important.</span></p>
            <p><span>But then, at the same time, I also just love to do stupid shit. So maybe it’s not always quite as
                high-minded as Kant’s definition suggests. (laughs)</span></p>
